This paper introduces Derived Energy Utilization Metrics (DEUM), a set of key performance indicators that stem from the analysis of power consumption data across various systems and processes. DEUM offers organizations tools to evaluate energy efficiency, track power usage patterns, and discover potential areas for energy-saving enhancements.

The metrics presented here were previously documented as part of the POWEFF Draft version 00 - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-opsawg-poweff/00/
