                   Derived Energy Utilization Metrics
                          draft-opsawg-deum-00

Abstract

   This paper introduces Derived Energy Utilization Metrics (DEUM), a
   set of key performance indicators that stem from the analysis of
   power consumption data across various systems and processes.  DEUM
   offers organizations tools to evaluate energy efficiency, track power
   usage patterns, and discover potential areas for energy-saving
   enhancements.

2.  Terminology

   Terminology and abbreviations used in this document:

   Asset

Internet-Draft                    deum                          May 2024


   Refers to hardware, software, applications, or services.  An asset
   can be physical or virtual, as defined in the Asset Lifecycle
   Management and Operations [I-D.draft-palmero-ivy-ps-almo-00] IETF
   draft.

   Scope 1

   Emissions directly caused by actions of the organization, such as
   when fossil fuels are burned when the organization is operating a
   fossil vehicle.  See Greenhouse Gas protocol
   (https://ghgprotocol.org/).

   Scope 2

   Emissions indirectly caused by actions of the organization, but under
   control of the organization.  For example, when electric energy is
   purchased, causing a provider utility to make emissions on behalf of
   the organization.  See Greenhouse Gas protocol
   (https://ghgprotocol.org/).

   Scope 3

   Emissions the organization indirectly causes others to make, but
   outside the organizations direct control.  Examples include the
   energy customers consume when operating the organization's products,
   or when employees commute to work at the organization.  See
   Greenhouse Gas protocol (https://ghgprotocol.org/).

   Scope 4 :

   Refers to the term used in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting and
   reporting to describe emissions that occur as a result of an
   organization's value chain activities, but are not directly
   controlled or owned by the organization.  Scope 4 emissions are
   considered indirect emissions and are typically associated with
   activities that are upstream or downstream from a organization's
   operations.  Such as when equipment provided by the organization
   enables a video conference, without which greater emissions from
   business travel would have happened.

   CO2eq

   Carbon dioxide equivalents, a measure of the disruptive force of
   greenhouse gas emissions.

   Power

   Refers to the electrical energy per unit time, supplied to operate an
   asset, such as a smartphone.  It is usually measured in units of
   watts.

   Energy Efficiency

   refers to the ability of an asset to perform its intended functions
   while minimizing energy consumption.  It refers to the ratio between
   the useful output energy and input energy given by an asset.  In a
   router or a switch, it is a measure of how efficiently the network
   element utilizes energy resources to transmit and process data or
   perform other network-related tasks.  See Energy efficiency wikipedia
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency).

3.  Motivation

   The primary focus of this document is to introduce Derived Energy
   Utilization Metrics (DEUM), which are indicators for monitoring
   energy consumption and its impact on CO2 equivalent emissions.  These
   metrics are crucial for understanding the energy efficiency of assets
   during their use phase as outlined by the GHG Protocol Accounting and
   Reporting Standard, consistent with ISO 14040:44 standards.  DEUM
   specifically targets the emissions associated with the use of goods
   and services, encompassing both the direct emissions (Scope 1) and
   indirect emissions (Scope 2) of end users, which are reported under
   Scope 3 category 11.  This category often represents a significant
   portion of the total emissions reported by an asset.

7.  Deployment Considerations

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations mentioned in section 17 of [RFC7950]
   apply.

   DEUM brings several security and privacy implications because of the
   various components and attributes of the information model.  For
   example, each functional component can be tampered with to give
   manipulated data.  DEUM when used alone or with other relevant data,
   can identify an individual, revealing Personal Identifiable
   Information (PII).  How the configuration of assets should be
   accomplished could lead to data being accessed by unauthorized
   entities.

   Methods exist to secure the communication of management information.
   The transport entity of the functional model MUST implement methods
   for secure transport.  This document also contains an Information
   model and Data-Model in which none of the objects defined are
   writable.  If the objects are deemed sensitive in a particular
   environment, access to them MUST be restricted using appropriately
   configured security and access control rights.  The information model
   contains several optional elements which can be enabled or disabled
   for the purpose of privacy and security.  Proper authentication and
   audit trail MUST be included for all the users/processes that access
   DEUM data.
